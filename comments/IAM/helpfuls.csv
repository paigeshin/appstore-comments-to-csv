Everything you take in is what you will put out. So by these positive affirmations which is the only thing I allow to notify me on my phone , when they pop up. It‚Äôs like a breath of fresh air. Nothing changes over night, but I have been looking this stuff up and reading into it for a while. Positive affirmations can change the way you think. Even if you think you can‚Äôt, just continue reading them and hearing them for a month . Watch how your life can change. We all should strive to be more positive human beings. I know it can be hard, especially since I come from a very abusive and violent back ground. You can change your negative thinking habits. I challenge you to trying positive affirmations for a month and to also be monitoring your thoughts...also called mental chatter. Try to calm your mind and always be in the present moment , and if you‚Äôre going to have thoughts. Do your best to always make them positive. Positive affirmations is one of the ways to help with this. I also learn from our teacher Jesus Christ. A lot to learn from the good Book. The Holy Bible. Guys try it and see. I wish everyone to find their purpose in life and to be more loving and show more compassion towards one another. May God bless you all.

The only issue I have is, say, if I open the app directly from my phone without clicking the notification with my daily affirmation, it displays a different affirmation altogether. So then instead of seeing the same one that I was notified about, I‚Äôll see a new one. Perhaps I‚Äôm not navigating the app correctly, but when I flip up and down on the affirmations, I don‚Äôt see the one that I was notified with. I try to be intentional about clicking on the app aka avoiding it and just focusing on the alert notification, however, sometimes I forget, and then it‚Äôs kind of a bummer.

Then they started advertising in app. My problem, advertisements for other apps by this company have started popping into my feed. 1. This is something that you usually pay for the premium version to escape ads. 2. The very premise of the app and of affirmations is that what you see, and read (and then possibly say) effects you. Having ads for the developer‚Äôs other apps in the middle of an affirmation practice is wrong. 

I‚Äôll be watching to see if this sticks around. I preferred this affirmations app for its clean and simple style both in looks and in use and the quality of its content.

This app has helped me so much. I set my number of reminders to 10 so I do get affirmations often which some may find annoying (but it‚Äôs a setting that can be changed).

The only way we can sift through the affirmations in our collection is through the edit collection section, but it doesn‚Äôt feel as good cause then it‚Äôs basically a list. I can achieve the same thing by writing out my affirmations on my notes app.

Another thing is it would be nice if we could delete an affirmation when we‚Äôre going through the ones we created ourselves. Or at least when we‚Äôre editing ‚Äúmy affirmations‚Äù, have a search bar at the top so we don‚Äôt have to scroll and look for the affirmation we want to delete.
